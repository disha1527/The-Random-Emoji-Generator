<h1>The Random Emoji Generator! 🚀</h1>

<p>The goal of this project is to create a random emoji generator with a "click" button that generates a random emoji and displays its name tag.
For example, the "cook" emoji is represented by a person holding a pen. We will use JavaScript to retrieve data from an API and CSS to style the website. 
To get the necessary API keys, we will apply to the Emoji API website.</p>

<h1>Key Features:</h1>
<p>- Endless emoji surprises to add a dash of creativity to your messages 😄🎉</p>
<p>- A user-friendly design for a delightful experience ⚙️</p>
